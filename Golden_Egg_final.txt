Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The egg provided enough money for the farmer and his wife for their day-to-day needs.

The farmer and his wife were happy for a long time. But one day, the farmer got an idea and thought, "Why should I take just one egg a day? Why can't I take all of

them at once and make a lot of money?" The foolish farmer's wife also agreed and decided to cut the goose's stomach for the eggs. As soon as they killed the bird and

opened the goose's stomach, to find nothing but guts and blood. The farmer, realizing his foolish mistake, cries over the lost resource!
